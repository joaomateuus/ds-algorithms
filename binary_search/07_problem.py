"""
Search in a nearly sorted array in logarithmic time

Given a nearly sorted array such that each of the n elements may be misplaced by no more than one position from the correct sorted order, search a given element in it efficiently. Report if the element is not present in the array.

An element at index i in a correctly sorted order can be misplaced by the Â± 1 position, i.e., it can be present at index i-1 or i or i+1 in the input array.
